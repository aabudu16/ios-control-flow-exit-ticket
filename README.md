## Question 1

What will happen when the code below is run?

```swift
var x = 10
if x = 15 {
 print("x is 15")
} else {
 print("x is not 15")
}

- It will print "x is 15"

- It will print "x is not 15"

- It will given an error because x is a var instead of a let

- It will give an error because it has "else" and not "else if"

- It will give an error because x =15 uses the assignment operator instead of the comparison operator

```

## Question 2

Test if number is divisible by 3, 5 and 7. For example 105 is divisible by 3, 5 and 7, but 120 is divisible only by 3 and 5 but not by 7. If number is divisible by 3, 5 and 7 print number is divisible by 3, 5 and 7 otherwise print number is not divisible by 3, 5 and 7.

```swift
let number = 210

// enter code below
```

## Question 3

What will happen when the code below is run?

```swift
var numberOfBagels = 15
let isOverADozen: Bool
if numberOfBagels > 12 {
    isOverADozen = true
} else {
    isOverADozen = false
}
if isOverADozen {
    print("You have more than 12!")
} else {
    print("You have less than 12!")
}

- It will print "You have more than 12!

- It will print "You have less than 12!

- It will not compile because numberOfBagels should be a constant

- It will not compile because isOverADozen should be a variable
```
